# React Practical Summary

```
This project is a simple React application created using Create React App. It demonstrates the basics of React components, JSX, and
rendering. The app consists of two main components:
Name Component (Name.js) → Displays a heading with the text “IT3133 P”.
App Component (App.js) → Displays the React logo and a short message “Mobile App with React”.

In index.js, both components are rendered inside React.StrictMode to ensure proper structure and best practices.
The reportWebVitals.js is included for performance monitoring (optional). The project also uses basic CSS files (index.css, App.css) for styling.

This practical serves as an introduction to React fundamentals including component creation, imports/exports, JSX usage, and rendering multiple components together in a single-page application.
